# EDA and pre-processing
- in 00_preprocess notebook, the 3x3 image plot needs to have its title fixed for arabic names:
    -  partial fixing: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15421746/matplotlib-writing-right-to-left-text-hebrew-arabic-etc
    - also add figure legends, axes+units etc to the plots before moving on to CNN
    
# CNN
- get pre-trained models (maybe 3 or 4), do HPO and compare accuracy/f1-score etc. --> goal is to show some work in CNN + how to choose architecture, not necessarily to achieve 100 % accuracy

# App for model deployment
- once the best model is done, do one final round of training and then save the model.
- use plotly to create a simple 'upload image' app


# report
- needs work
